# DATA-ACQUISITION-SYSTEM-WITH-GRAPHIC-INTERFACE

Graph_Arduino implement a data acquisition system with graphic interface, that offer a conversion analog-digital and a
interface of communication with a personal computer. 
ItÂ´s possible to execute simples processing and gerate logs with the datas.
